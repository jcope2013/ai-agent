1. Dependencies: The files share dependencies on several npm packages, including "next", "react", "react-dom", "typescript", "tailwindcss", "postcss", "autoprefixer", and "@types/node".

2. Exported Variables: The "_app.tsx" file exports a default function App that wraps the entire application and is used in other files. The "index.tsx" file exports a default function Home that represents the homepage of the app. The "MyComponent.tsx" file exports a default function MyComponent that represents a reusable component.

3. Data Schemas: There are no explicit data schemas shared between these files. However, the TypeScript configuration file "tsconfig.json" defines the general type checking rules for the entire application.

4. ID Names of DOM Elements: There are no specific ID names shared between these files as the prompt does not specify any DOM manipulation or specific component interaction.

5. Message Names: There are no specific message names shared between these files as the prompt does not specify any event handling or messaging system.

6. Function Names: The function names "App", "Home", and "MyComponent" are shared between the files "pages/_app.tsx", "pages/index.tsx", and "components/MyComponent.tsx" respectively. These functions represent the main application, the homepage, and a reusable component.

7. CSS Classes: The "globals.css" file and "MyComponent.module.css" file share Tailwind CSS utility classes. These classes are used to style the components in the application.

8. Configuration Files: The "postcss.config.js" and "tailwind.config.js" files share configuration settings for PostCSS and Tailwind CSS respectively. These settings are used across the entire application for styling purposes.
